    -- git init
    == add a dummy file
    -- commit tha file locally
    -- create a repo in remote
    -- git remote add orign {remote repo link}
    -- change the branch to main (git branch -M main)(change the name from master to main)
    -- upstream the local main branch with remote main branch
    -- push it to remote
